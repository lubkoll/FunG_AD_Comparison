In this folder you find the examples of adipose and muscle tissue for the computations of Section 6: Comparison with AD-libraries.
All examples are compiled with the compiler flags "-std=c++1y -O3 -DNDEBUG" 

Subfolders:

  - ex1: f(x)     = x^{3/2} + sin(sqrt{x})
  - ex2: f(x)     = cos(x) + sin(exp(sqrt{x})+1)
  - ex3: f(x,y,z) = y*sqrt{x} + sin(sqrt{x}) + z
 
 
In each of the subfolders the corresponding examples can be compiled and run with the following commands:
 
  - mkdir build
  - cd build
  - cmake ..
  - make
  - ./compare
